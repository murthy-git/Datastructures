How to use the HEAP code:

Creating a new Min/Max heap:
      To create a new Min or Max heap, you have to create an object for the respective class. you can give elements while creating object as class parameters or
      you can use push function to add new elements to the heap -> object = MaxHeap(1,4,7)

push(*elements): 
      This function is used to add elements to the heap. This function takes any number of elements from 0 to infinity as argument, adds each element 
      to the heap and re-arranges the heap -> object.push(3,8)

pop(): 
      This function is used to pop the first element from the heap. This function takes no arguments. -> object.pop()

peek(): 
      This function is used to see the first element of the heap -> object.peek()

Note: 
      If you want to see the entire heap, call _heap variable -> print(object._heap)
